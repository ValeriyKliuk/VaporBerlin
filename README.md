#### I re-thought how to write tutorials and create templates and came up with <a href="https://github.com/vaporberlin/vaporschool">VaporSchool</a>!
With VaporSchool it doesn't matter how experienced you are (aren't). Be it you just started with vapor or already implemented some apps. I want to help you to get to the next level!

2. [CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)](Examples/crud-example)
3. VALIDATION (Email and Username etc.)
4. LEAF (Templating)
5. CONTROLLER
6. [AUTH (Authentication and Authorization)](Examples/auth-example)
7. [TESTING (macOS)](Examples/test-example)
8. TESTING (Linux)
9. MIDDLEWARE
